# monday_moody_bot
A twitter mood analyzing bot

This bot analyzes the mood of the mentions that it receives on Twitter. 

For the analysis there has been used the service called MonkeyLearn (you can check them out here https://monkeylearn.com/).

For interaction with the Twitter API I used the codebird dependency (https://github.com/jublo/codebird-php).

In order to pull down all the dependencies I used the dependency manager Composer (https://getcomposer.org/).

Have fun ðŸ¤ª
